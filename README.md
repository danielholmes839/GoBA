# GoBA

Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game written in Go (GoBA). The goal of this project is to recreate some of the mechanics seen in games like League of Legends and Dota. This will include:

- Vision: who / what your team can't see, and show this to the client with "fog of war"
- Pathing: finding a path across the map
- Teams, abilties, health, respawn timers, a camera system, and more...
